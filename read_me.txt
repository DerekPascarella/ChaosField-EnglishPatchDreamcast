.------------::[ v1.0 Release Notes ]::-------------
|
| Inspired by the English translation patch for Radirgy released just a couple
| of days ago by wiredcrackpot (http://www.romhacking.net/community/7247/), I
| decided to take a quick peek at another late MileStone shooter on my beloved
| Dreamcast: Chaos Field.  As some of you might know, I'm currently in the
| middle of what will likely be a year-long project for my next translation
| patch, but this one was so easy, I just had to whip it together.
|
| I originally planned to borrow the English assets from the GameCube version,
| just like wiredcrackpot used the Wii version for Radirgy.  However, my job
| was even simpler than that.  The standard retail release of Chaos Field
| actually shipped with about 80% of the English text and images already baked
| into the disc.  All I had to do was flip a proverbial switch and then
| translate that remaining 20%!
|
| There isn't much else to say, other than to comment on the fact that this
| game was already pretty English-friendly.  However, with this patch you will
| not encounter a single piece of Japanese text throughout your play, whether
| it be in the menus, the tutorials, the character selection, or even the end
| credits.  The only real exception to this is the subtitle below the Chaos
| Field logo, which itself actually says Chaos Field, and thus deserves to stay.
|
| With that, I hope everyone out there enjoys playing this game in English on
| SEGA's beautiful swan-song console.  As always, I'd like to give a gigantic
| thank you to the incredible Dreamcast community, without whom my life would
| feel incomplete.  Together, we can keep The Dreamâ„¢ alive...
